Solving a Dirichlet problem for ODE of order 4
This programm solves biharmonic equation using collocation method. More precisely: the interval is fractioned into cells; for each cell there are local coordinate system in which system of equations is defined; then, after combining this systems with coherent condtitions, the global system of linear equaitons is defined. The global system is solved using Givens rotation. The solution is approximated by monomials.
